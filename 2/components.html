    <h1>Understanding Computer Components</h1>

    <p>A computer is a complex machine made up of various hardware components that work together to process data and
        perform tasks. Below are some of the essential components of a computer, along with links to Wikipedia articles
        for further reading.</p>

    <h2>Key Computer Components:</h2>
