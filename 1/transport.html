    <h1>Transport of the Future</h1>

    <p>The future of transportation promises revolutionary changes in how we move people and goods. Emerging
        technologies such as autonomous vehicles, electric aviation, and hyperloop systems are set to redefine the way
        we travel and transport materials, making it faster, safer, and more sustainable.</p>

    <h2>Key Innovations in Future Transport</h2>

    <p>Several groundbreaking advancements are poised to reshape the transportation landscape. These include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>**Autonomous Vehicles**: Self-driving cars and trucks will reduce accidents and improve traffic flow by
            eliminating human error.</li>
        <li>**Electric Aviation**: Electric planes and drones will reduce the carbon footprint of air travel and make
            air transportation more accessible.</li>
        <li>**Hyperloop Systems**: High-speed, tube-based transportation promises to cut travel times between cities to
            mere minutes.</li>
        <li>**Smart Infrastructure**: Roads and cities equipped with sensors and AI will optimize traffic patterns and
            reduce congestion.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>Did you know?</strong> Hyperloop technology could transport passengers at speeds exceeding 1,000
            km/h, making it one of the fastest modes of transportation envisioned for the near future.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Impact of Sustainable Transport</h2>

    <p>Future transportation solutions are not just about speed and convenience. They are also focused on
        sustainability. Electric vehicles, renewable energy-powered trains, and smart infrastructure are aimed at
        reducing emissions and making global transportation more eco-friendly.</p>
