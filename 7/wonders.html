    <h1>The Wonders of the Natural World</h1>

    <!-- Section 1: The Grand Canyon -->
    <h2>The Grand Canyon</h2>
    <p>
        The Grand Canyon is one of the most remarkable natural formations in the world. It is located in the state of
        Arizona, USA, and stretches for over 277 miles. The canyon was carved over millions of years by the Colorado
        River. Its depth reaches over a mile, providing breathtaking views and revealing layers of geological history.
        More information can be found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canyon"
            target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Grand Canyon offers visitors numerous activities such as hiking, rafting, and helicopter tours. It has been
        a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979. With its unique landscapes, the canyon attracts millions of visitors
        each year. The best time to visit is during the spring or fall when the weather is mild. The Grand Canyon is
        also home to various wildlife species, including bighorn sheep and California condors.

    <!-- Section 2: The Great Barrier Reef -->
    <h2>The Great Barrier Reef</h2>
    <p>
        The Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef system in the world. It is located off the coast of Queensland,
        Australia, and is composed of over 2,900 individual reefs. The reef system is about 1,400 miles long and can be
        seen from space. This incredible ecosystem is home to thousands of marine species, including fish, coral,
        sharks, and sea turtles. You can learn more about it on <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Great Barrier Reef is a popular destination for scuba divers and snorkelers. It was designated a UNESCO
        World Heritage Site in 1981. Unfortunately, the reef is currently facing threats from climate change and coral
        bleaching. Efforts are being made to protect and preserve this natural wonder. It remains a vital habitat for
        marine life and a source of tourism revenue for Australia.

    <!-- Section 3: Mount Everest -->
    <h2>Mount Everest</h2>
    <p>
        Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world, standing at 29,032 feet above sea level. It is located in
        the Himalayas, on the border between Nepal and the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. Everest has long been a
        symbol of human endurance and achievement. The first successful ascent to the summit was made by Sir Edmund
        Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953. For more details, visit <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Everest" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Climbing Mount Everest is a challenge that attracts hundreds of mountaineers every year. The journey is
        dangerous due to extreme cold, high winds, and the risk of avalanches. Despite these risks, the mountain remains
        a symbol of adventure and exploration. Everest is also of great cultural significance to the local Sherpa
        people, who have lived in its shadow for centuries. The best climbing season is typically from late April to
        early June.
